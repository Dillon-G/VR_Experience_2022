CSC 495 Fall 2022 Group Project
Authors: Dillon Gillespie, Abdoul Barry, Hubert Liu

This project's main focus is being a shooting range with a selection of different weaponry. Our focus for the novel interaction technique is using the keyboard interaction to allow for the user to select options from a UI they pull up on their controller. The UI will allow them to swap between weaponry and change the scenery.
